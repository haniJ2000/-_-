# 🌸 Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

* 🎯 Goal:Assigning iris blooms to one of three species—Versicolor, Setosa, or Virginica—based on precise measurements is the aim of this job. The sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width are among these measurements. This well-known dataset is used in machine learning to illustrate the operation of classification algorithms.
* 💡 Model:k-nearest neighbors from Scikit-learn.
* 📊 Dataset: Contains flower measurements and species labels.[Download the Iris dataset here](https://example.com/iris-dataset)



# 🚘 Task 3: Car Price Prediction

* 🎯 Goal: Build a model to predict car prices based on features such as brand, mileage etc.
* 💡 Model: Use Linear Regression.
* 📊 Dataset: Explore data with car specs and prices. [Download the Car Price dataset here](https://example.com/car-price-dataset)



# 🛒 Task 4: Sales Prediction.

*  🎯 Goal: Forecast future sales based on advertising strategies, target audiences, and platforms.
*  💡 Model: Apply Linear regression
*  📊 Dataset: Sales data with marketing factors included.[Download the Sales dataset here](https://example.com/sales-dataset)
